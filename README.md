# NewLayoutCTA

This is the repository for the building of CTA software. 
It is right now open access, this means anyone can access it on the web.

To do list, and assignments:
- save petri dish size and radius in AAC => (Clément, ongoing)
- allow a batch mode analysis for timelapse movies: master folder, goes over all sub folders
- allow user to resize image to smaller one for speed 
        * warning sizes of colonies obtained!
        * One possibility is to directly use a smaller image at loading (but not for analyis?)
- update todo list from Mathilde and Clément prvious discussions => (Clément)
- allow the user to select the contrasting program (W)
- allow the user to select the colony detection program (W)
- auto detect the plate to minimize analysis time (W)
- add a function to add centers without bothering with diameter (counts only) (W)
- minimize manual analysis time by clever uploading of picture (compressed?) and clever refresh (B)
- get better analysis for timelapse: edge detection from outside (B)
